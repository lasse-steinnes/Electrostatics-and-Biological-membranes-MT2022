# Simulation and analysis of biomolecular model systems with HyMD

Hello there, and welcome to this Github-page, which is dedicated to the code relevant for my thesis, completing the degree M.sc. Computational Science: Physics (2020-2022)

### Main overview:
* This repository contains programmes used in the simulation and analysis of biological model systems of Lipid A hexa and Lipid Re penta, which is both chemical components  of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharides in gram negative bacteria.
