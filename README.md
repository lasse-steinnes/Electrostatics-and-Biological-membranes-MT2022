# Simulation and analysis of biomolecular model systems with HyMD

Hello there, and welcome to this Github-page, which is dedicated to the code relevant for my thesis, completing the degree M.sc. Computational Science: Physics (2020-2022).

### Main overview:
* This repository contains programmes used in the simulation and analysis of biological model systems of Lipid A hexa and Lipid Re penta, which is both chemical components  of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharides in gram negative bacteria.
* Specifically, I develop an iterative method for solving a general Poisson equation in the HylleraasMD ([HyMD](https://github.com/Cascella-Group-UiO/HyMD)) molecular dynamics platform. 
* The Hylleraas platform is associated with the [Hylleraas Centre for Quantum Molecular Sciences](https://www.mn.uio.no/hylleraas/english/). It implements the Hamiltonian formalism of the hybrid particle-field, and is a software applied to simulate coarse-grained models of softmatter systems in the canonical and isothermalâ€“isobaric (in-preparation) ensembles. HyMD uses [PMESH](https://github.com/rainwoodman/pmesh) backend with fast fourier transforms for parallel architectures.

### Thesis Abstract
I develop an iterative method to solve a general Poisson equation in Fourier space, with a variable dielectric. The iterative method is implemented in the molecular dynamics software HylleraasMD, using the Hamiltonian hPF formalism.
%I develop an iterative method to solve a general Poisson equation in Fourier space, with a variable dielectric. The iterative method is implemented in the molecular dynamics software HylleraasMD. The platform uses the newly developed Hamiltonian formalism of the hybrid-particle field to obtain long range and non-bonded forces from a cloud-in-cell representation of coarse grain beads, making it possible to simulate large systems efficiently over biologically relevant time scales.

First, I benchmark the iterative method with known cases. The method reproduces the electrostatic potential from an analytically constructed charge number density. When comparing with the Coulomb interaction of point particles, the iterative method yields reasonable magnitudes in force and energy, and momentum and energy are conserved. In addition, the method reproduces the behaviour of a 5mM electrolytic solution, with ideal monovalent ions dissolved in a biphase of liquid oil and water. 

Secondly, I simulate systems of Lipid A and Lipid Re with divalent counter-ions in the NVT ensemble, applying two constant dielectric values and two variable dielectric functions. Results are benchmarked with density profiles  of all-atom simulations of the same systems. Model membranes of LA6 and LPS Re are in agreement with the reference membrane, except for low relative dielectric values, implying screening from polar moieties is necessary to preserve a lamellar bilayer. 

Lastly, I optimize Flory Huggins mixing parameters with Bayesian optimization, for Lipid A. Optimization increase R2-fitness and reduce RMSE-scores, with no significant differences between trajectories for chosen dielectric parameters. Transferred to Lipid Re, optimized parameters give an improvement in R2 and RMSE compared to unoptimized parameters sets, except for the oligosaccharide chain, which is not present in Lipid A.
