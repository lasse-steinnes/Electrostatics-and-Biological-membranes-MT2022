# Simulation and analysis of biomolecular model systems with HyMD

Hello there, and welcome to this Github-page, which is dedicated to the code relevant for my thesis, completing the degree M.sc. Computational Science: Physics (2020-2022).

### Main overview:
* This repository contains programmes used in the simulation and analysis of biological model systems of Lipid A hexa and Lipid Re penta, which is both chemical components  of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharides in gram negative bacteria.
* Specifically, I develop an iterative method for solving a general Poisson equation in the HylleraasMD ([HyMD](https://github.com/Cascella-Group-UiO/HyMD)) molecular dynamics platform. 
* The Hylleraas platform is associated with the [Hylleraas Centre for Quantum Molecular Sciences](https://www.mn.uio.no/hylleraas/english/). It implements the Hamiltonian formalism of the hybrid particle-field, and is a software applied to simulate coarse-grained models of softmatter systems in the canonical and isothermalâ€“isobaric (in-preparation) ensembles. HyMD uses [PMESH](https://github.com/rainwoodman/pmesh) backend with fast fourier transforms for parallel architectures.
