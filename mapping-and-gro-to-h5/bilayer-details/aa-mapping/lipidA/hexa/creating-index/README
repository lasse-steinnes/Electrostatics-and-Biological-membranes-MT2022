[ Steps ]

- Created cgbuilder.ndx through this website: https://jbarnoud.github.io/cgbuilder/
- Generate an executable for the first fortran code: gfortran functions.f90 mapping.f90 -o map-lipidA
- Run it (it will generate the new.ndx file - mapping of all 256 lipids): ./map-lipidA
- Generate an executable for the second fortran code: gfortran w-ions.f90 -o w-ions
- Run it (it will generate the vai.ndx file - mapping of water molecules and ions): ./w-ions
- Concatenate both ndx files: cat new.ndx vai.ndx > new2.ndx
